# MLP
Modular MLP in Python from scratch

This is a modular Multilayer Perceptron project from scratch. Without using ML frameworks such as Tensorflow or PyTorch it is possible to gain a much better understanding of single components of ML models. Therefore, this project will contain a detailed documentation throughout the whole implementation process.
