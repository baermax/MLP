# MLP
Modular MLP in Python from scratch

This is a modular Multilayer Perceptron project from scratch. Even though common ML frameworks such as Tensorflow or PyTorch democratize the world of Machine Learning and make it accessable to everyone, only a few peoble know how to use them on an advanced level. Implementing ML models from scratch can help to understand better what Machine Learning concepts are capable of and why, as well as how specific parameters can be used to improve a model's performance. 
Therefore, this project will contain a detailed documentation throughout the whole implementation process of one popular ML concept, the so-called Multilayer Perceptron.
